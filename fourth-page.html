          <h1>Chris "CT" Tamburello</h1>
          <h2>Since CT began competing in The Challenge in 2004 he has been a fan favorite. He first competed in season 8: The Inferno and has since competed in 18 seasons (including the current season: 37). In recent seasons, CT has been the bennifactor of felow competitor's fear to go against him in elimination rounds and finals. This intimidation comes from years of experience and a few instances of physical altercations that cut some of his seasons short.</h2>
