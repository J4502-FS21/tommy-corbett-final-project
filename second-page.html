          <h2>After the airing of the 37th season, MTV and The Challenge will have given out over $14,000,000 to winners. Two contestants, Ashley Mitchell and Johnny Bananas, are the only ones to surpass $1 million in winnings over their time on the show. The show first awarded $1 million in prize money in season 30: Dirty 30, which aired in 2017.</h2>

        <h2 class="funfact">In the finale of season 28: Rivals III, finalists who scored better than their partner were given the opportunity to keep all their winnings to themselves instead of splitting the prize. First place finisher, Johnny Bananas, decided to keep the $275,000 to himself, sending co-winner and his final challenge partner, Sarah Rice, home empty handed.</h2>
