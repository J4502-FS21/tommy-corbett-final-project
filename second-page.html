        <h2 class="funfact">In the finale of season 28: Rivals III, finalists who scored better than their partner were given the opportunity to keep all their winnings to themselves instead of splitting the prize. First place finisher, Johnny Bananas, decided to keep the $275,000 to himself, sending co-winner and his final challenge partner, Sarah Rice, home empty handed.</h2>
